# Q02. Leap Year Checker (if-else)
#
# Ask the user for a year (integer).
# Print whether it is a leap year or not.
#
# Rules:
#   - Divisible by 4 → leap year
#   - BUT divisible by 100 → NOT a leap year
#   - UNLESS also divisible by 400 → leap year
#
# Sample Input 1:   Enter a year: 2024
# Sample Output 1:  2024 is a leap year
#
# Sample Input 2:   Enter a year: 1900
# Sample Output 2:  1900 is not a leap year

# --- YOUR CODE HERE ---
year=int(input("Enter a year:"))
if ( year %4==0):
  if (year % 100==0):
    if (year % 400==0):
      print(f"{year} is a leap year ")
    else:
      print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
    else:
      #Dividd by 4 but not by 100
    print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
